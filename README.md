## 💡 Description
This repository contains a Wav2Lip Studio extension for Automatic1111. 

It's an all-in-one solution: just choose a video and a speech file (wav or mp3), and the extension will generate a lip-sync video. It improves the quality of the lip-sync videos generated by the [Wav2Lip tool](https://github.com/Rudrabha/Wav2Lip) by applying specific post-processing techniques with Stable diffusion tools.

## 🐍 Usage
1. Choose a video (avi or mp4 format) with a face in it. If there is no face in only one frame of the video, process will fail. Note avi file will not appear in Video input but process will works.
2. Audio, 2 options:
   1. Put audio file in the "Speech" input. 
   2. Generate Audio with the text to speech [bark](https://github.com/suno-ai/bark/) integration.
      1. Choose the language : Turkish, English, Chinese, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Polish, German, French
      2. Choose the Gender
      3. Choose your speaker, you can ear a sample in the "Audio Example"
      4. Choose Low VRAM True (default) if you have a Video Card with less than 16GB VRAM 
      5. Write your text in the text area "Prompt"
         - **Note** that bark can only generate 14 seconds of audio, so if you want to generate a longer audio, you have to use  "[split]" in your text.  
         - For example, if you want to generate a 30 seconds audio, you have to write your text like this :
           - "This is the first part of my text **[split]** This is the second part of my text"
      6. Temperature: 0.0 is supposed to be closer to the voice, and 1.0 is more creative, but in reality, 0.0 yields strange results and 1.0 something very far from the voice. 0.7 is the default value set by 'bark', try different values to see what works best for you.
      7. Silence : Time in seconds between each punctuation(。！!.？?,). Default is 0.25 seconds.
      8. See Bark [documentation](https://github.com/suno-ai/bark/) for more details.
      9. Below is a list of some known non-speech sounds.
         - [laughter]
         - [laughs]
         - [sighs]
         - [music]
         - [gasps]
         - [clears throat]
         - "-" or ... for hesitations
         - ♪ for song lyrics
         - CAPITALIZATION for emphasis of a word
         - [MAN] and [WOMAN] to bias Bark toward male and female speakers, respectively
3. choose a checkpoint (see table above).
4. **Padding**: Wav2Lip uses this to move the mouth. This is useful if the mouth is not at the good place. Usually, default value is good, but certain video may need to be adjusted.
5. **No Smooth**: When checked, this option retains the original mouth shape without smoothing.
6. **Resize Factor**: This is a resize factor for the video. The default value is 1.0, but you can change it to suit your needs. This is useful if the video size is too large.
7. **Only Mouth**: This option tracks only the mouth, removing other facial motions like those of the cheeks and chin.
8. **Mouth Mask Dilate**: This will dilate the mouth mask to cover more area around the mouth. depends on the mouth size.
9. **Face Mask Erode**: This will erode the face mask to remove some area around the face. depends on the face size.
10. **Mask Blur**: This will blur the mask to make it more smooth, try to keep it under or equal to **Mouth Mask Dilate**.
11. **Code Former Fidelity**: 
    1. A value of 0 offers higher quality but may significantly alter the person's facial appearance and cause noticeable flickering between frames.
    2. A value of 1 provides lower quality but maintains the person's face more consistently and reduces frame flickering.
    3. Using a value below 0.5 is not advised. Adjust this setting to achieve optimal results. Starting with a value of 0.75 is recommended.
12. **Active debug**: This will create step-by-step images in the debug folder.
13. Click on the "Generate" button.

## 👄 Note on the bark Fidelity

Bark is interesting but sometimes yields strange results (or even hilarious ones). Each generation will give you something different and It may take several generations before you achieve something conclusive. 
Apart from English, it seems that the other languages speak as if they were being used by a foreigner. Sometimes even if you choose "Male" it will speak like a woman, and vice versa. Sometimes, even when choosing a specific speaker, it will sound like another speaker or even another language.

## 📖 Behind the scenes

This extension operates in several stages to improve the quality of Wav2Lip-generated videos:

1. **Generate a Wav2lip video**: The script first generates a low-quality Wav2Lip video using the input video and audio.
2. **Video Quality Enhancement**: Create a high-quality video using the low-quality video by using the enhancer define by user. 
3. **Mask Creation**: The script creates a mask around the mouth and tries to keep other facial motions like those of the cheeks and chin.
4. **Video Generation**: The script then takes the high-quality mouth image and overlays it onto the original image guided by the mouth mask.
5. **Video Post Processing**: The script then uses the ffmpeg tool to generate the final video.

## 💪 Quality tips
- Use a high quality video as input
- Utilize a video with a consistent frame rate. Occasionally, videos may exhibit unusual playback frame rates (not the standard 24, 25, 30, 60), which can lead to issues with the face mask.
- Use a high quality audio file as input, without background noise or music. Clean audio with a tool like [https://podcast.adobe.com/enhance](https://podcast.adobe.com/enhance).
- Try to minimize the grain on the face on the input as much as possible. For example, you can use the "Restore faces" feature in img2img before using an image as input for Wav2Lip.
- Dilate the mouth mask. This will help the model retain some facial motion and hide the original mouth.
- Mask Blur maximum twice the value of Mouth Mask Dilate. If you want to increase the blur, increase the value of Mouth Mask Dilate otherwise the mouth will be blurred and the underlying mouth could be visible.
- Upscaling can be good for improving result, particularly around the mouth area. However, it will extend the processing duration. Use this tutorial from Olivio Sarikas to upscale your video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z4MKUqFEUk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z4MKUqFEUk). Ensure the denoising strength is set between 0.0 and 0.05, select the 'revAnimated' model, and use the batch mode. i'll create a tutorial for this soon.
- Ensure there is a face on each frame of the video. If the face is not detected, process will stop.

## ⚠ Noted Constraints
- The model may struggle with beards.
- If the initial phase is excessively lengthy, consider using the "resize factor" to decrease the video's dimensions.
- While there's no strict size limit for videos, larger videos will require more processing time. It's advisable to employ the "resize factor" to minimize the video size and then upscale the video once processing is complete.

## 📖 Troubleshooting
- Mac users: dlib will not install correctly. in requirements.txt, replace "dlib-bin" with "dlib"

## 📝 To do
- [ ] Tutorials
- [ ] Convert avi to mp4. Avi is not show in video input but process work fine
- [ ] Add Possibility to use a video for audio input
